# APK Build Fix Documentation

## Issue
GitHub Actions was failing to extract .apk files during the Flutter build process.

## Root Cause
The Android build configuration was missing proper Flutter plugin integration, causing the APK build to fail.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated android/app/build.gradle
- Added `id "dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin"` to plugins block
- Replaced hardcoded Android configuration with Flutter-provided values:
  - `compileSdk flutter.compileSdkVersion`
  - `minSdkVersion flutter.minSdkVersion`
  - `targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion`
  - `versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()`
  - `versionName flutterVersionName`
- Added `flutter { source '../..' }` configuration block

### 2. Updated android/settings.gradle
- Added pluginManagement block with Flutter plugin configuration
- Added Flutter SDK path resolution with fallback for CI environments
- Included Flutter tools gradle build

### 3. Updated android/build.gradle
- Removed buildscript block (Flutter handles this automatically)
- Simplified configuration as Flutter manages dependencies

### 4. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
- Added Java 17 setup for compatibility
- Maintained existing Flutter setup and APK build steps

## Expected Result
- APK builds should now succeed in GitHub Actions
- APK artifacts should be properly generated and uploaded
- Build process is now properly integrated with Flutter's gradle system

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`
- `android/app/build.gradle`
- `android/build.gradle`
- `android/settings.gradle`
